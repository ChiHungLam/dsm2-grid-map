				<p>
					A thin wrapper on
					<a href="http://cdec.water.ca.gov">CDEC</a>
					data.
					<br />
					You can search by narrowing the list of markers by type of data such as flow, electrical conductivity, oxygen etc. Either select it from the list or simply type in the box next to it. Select one the sensor types from the list presented in either case.
					<br/>
					The map will then update with icons (if there are too many icons, they may get clustered with a number of icons clustered displayed.
					<br/>
					Hover over an icon to see its 3 letter station id or click the icon. An information box will display above the icon with the description of the station as a link. Clicking on the descriptive name of the station will load data from that CDEC station.
					<br/> 
					The data will display below the map after a few seconds. Click on any link in the data displayed to be redirected in another page to the CDEC website. If this last step doesn't seem to work it maybe that the page is already open and behind the current one.
